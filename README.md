Smart Light Control with YOLOv8 and Camera

This project uses a camera and YOLOv8 object detection to implement a smart light system. The light automatically turns on when a person is detected and off when no person is present.

Features

Real-time person detection using YOLOv8.

Controls a light via HTTP request to a networked relay (on/off).

Threaded design for smooth camera capture and frame processing.

Displays camera feed with bounding boxes showing detected people.

Prevents repeated commands by storing the current light state.

Hardware & Setup
Component	Description / Connection
Camera	USB or built-in camera connected to PC
Relay / Light	Connected via network API at 192.168.1.111

Note: You need a relay that can receive HTTP GET requests for turning the light on/off.

Software Requirements

Python 3.x

Libraries:

opencv-python

ultralytics (for YOLOv8)

requests

Hardware: Any PC/laptop with a webcam.

Install required libraries via pip:

pip install opencv-python ultralytics requests

Usage

Run the script:

python smart_light_yolo.py


The program runs two threads:

Camera Thread: continuously captures frames from the webcam.

Processing Thread: detects people with YOLOv8, controls the light, and displays annotated video.

Controls the light automatically:

Turns on if at least one person is detected.

Turns off if no person is detected.

Press 'q' to exit the program.

Code Overview
# Pseudo-overview
# 1. Camera Thread: captures frames into shared variable
# 2. Processing Thread: runs YOLOv8 detection
# 3. Count number of "person" detected
# 4. Send HTTP request to light relay if needed
# 5. Display annotated frames


Uses threading.Lock() to safely share frames between threads.

YOLOv8 model used: yolov8n.pt (lightweight and fast).

Prevents repeated light toggling by storing the current_light_state.

Example Output (Serial / Console)
Detected 1 person
Light turned ON
Detected 0 persons
Light turned OFF


Bounding boxes of detected persons are shown in the camera window.

Notes

Ensure the relayâ€™s IP and API matches your network configuration.

Adjust YOLOv8 model (yolov8n.pt) if you need higher accuracy or speed.

Program is thread-safe and designed for real-time operation.
